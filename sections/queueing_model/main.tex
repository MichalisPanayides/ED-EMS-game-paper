\section{A queueing model for the ED-EMS interface}\label{sec:queueing_model}
In this section, a more in-depth explanation of the queueing model shown in 
figure \ref{fig:diagram_of_queueing_system} will be given.
This is a queueing model that consists of two waiting zones; the parking space
and the hospital waiting space.

    \caption{A diagrammatic representation of the queueing model. 
    The threshold \(T\) only applies to type 2 individuals.
    If the number of individuals in the hospital is \(T\), only 
    individuals of type 1 
    are accepted (at a rate \(\lambda_1\)) and individuals of type 2
    (arriving at a rate \(\lambda_2\)) are blocked in the parking space.}
    \label{fig:diagram_of_queueing_system}
\end{figure}

The model consists of two types of individuals; type 1 and type 2.
Type 2 individuals are patients arriving in ambulances who can be blocked 
(usually patients that are deemed not to be critical) 
and type 1 individuals are individuals arriving from other sources 
(e.g walk-in patients, urgent patients from either walk-ins or ambulances).
Type 1 individuals arrive instantly at the hospital's waiting space and wait to
receive their service. 
Type 2 individuals arrive at the parking space and wait there until they are 
allowed to move to the hospital.
They are allowed to proceed only when the number of 
patients in the hospital is less than the
pre-determined threshold \(T\).
When the number of individuals is equal to or exceeds this threshold, all 
type 2 patients that arrive will stay 
\textit{blocked} in the parking space until the number of patients in 
the hospital falls below \(T\). 
This is shown diagrammatically in Figure \ref{fig:diagram_of_queueing_system}.
The parameters of the described queueing model are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\lambda_i\): The arrival rate of individuals of type 
    \(i\in\{1, 2\}\)
    \item \(\mu\): The service rate for individuals receiving service
    \item \(C\): The number of servers (either healthcare professionals
    or available beds in the ED)
    \item \(T\): The threshold at which type 2 individuals are blocked
\end{itemize}

Under the assumption that all rates (arrival and service) are Markovian the
queueing system corresponds to a Markov chain~\cite{kemeny1976markov}.
The states of the Markov chain are denoted by \((u,v)\) where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(u\) is the number of individuals blocked in the parking space
    \item \(v\) is the number of individuals waiting or being served in the
    hospital
\end{itemize}

We denote the state space of the Markov chain as  \(S=S(T)\) which can be 
written as the disjoint union (\ref{eq:definition_of_S_as_disjoint_union}).

\begin{align}
    S(T) =& S_1(T) \cup S_2(T) \text{ where:} \nonumber \\
    S_1(T) =& \left\{(0, v)\in\mathbb{N}_0^2 \; | \; v < T \right\} 
    \label{eq:definition_of_S_as_disjoint_union} \\
    S_2(T) =& \{(u, v)\in\mathbb{N}_0^2 \; | \; v \geq T \} \nonumber
\end{align}

The generator matrix \(Q\) of the Markov chain consists of the 
rates between the numerous states of the model. 
Every entry \( Q_{ij} = Q_{(u_i, v_i),(u_j, v_j)} \) represents the rate from 
state \( i = (u_i, v_i) \) to state \( j = (u_j , v_j) \) for all 
\( (u_i, v_i), (u_j, v_j) \in S \).
The entries of \(Q\) can be calculated using the state-mapping function 
described in (\ref{eq:markov_transition_rate}): 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:markov_transition_rate}
    Q_{ij} = 
    \begin{cases}
        \Lambda, & \textbf{if } (u_i, v_i) - (u_j, v_j) = (0,-1) \textbf{ and } 
        v_i < \text{t} \\
        \lambda_1, & \textbf{if } (u_i, v_i) - (u_j, v_j) = (0,-1) 
        \textbf{ and } v_i \geq \text{t} \\
        \lambda_2, & \textbf{if } (u_i, v_i) - (u_j, v_j) = (-1,0) \\
        v_i \mu, & \textbf{if } (u_i, v_i) - (u_j, v_j) = (0,1) \textbf{ and } 
        v_i \leq C \textbf{ or} \\ & \hspace{0.37cm}(u_i, v_i) - (u_j, v_j) = 
        (1,0) \textbf{ and } v_i = T \leq C \\
        C \mu, & \textbf{if } (u_i, v_i) - (u_j, v_j) = (0,1) \textbf{ and } 
        v_i > C 
        \textbf{ or} \\ & \hspace{0.37cm}(u_i, v_i) - (u_j, v_j) = (1,0) 
        \textbf{ and } v_i = T > C\\
        -\sum_{j=1}^{|Q|}{Q_{ij}} & \textbf{if } i = j \\
        0, & \textbf{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Note that \(\Lambda\) here denotes the overall arrival rate in the model by both 
types of individuals (i.e. \(\Lambda = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2\)). 
A visualisation of how the transition rates relate to the states of the model 
can be seen in the general Markov chain model shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:general_markov_model}.

\input{imgs/general_markov_model/main.tex}


In order to consider this model numerically an adjustment needs to be made. 
The problem defined above assumes no upper boundary to the number of patients 
that can wait in the hospital or to the ones that are blocked in the parking 
space.
Therefore, a different state space \( \tilde S \) is constructed where
\( \tilde S \subseteq S \) and there is a maximum allowed number of patients 
\(N\) that can be in the hospital and a maximum allowed number of ambulances 
\(M\) that can be blocked in the parking space:

\begin{equation}
    \tilde S = \left\{ (u, v) \in S\;| u \leq M, v\leq N \right\}
\end{equation}


The generator matrix \( Q \) defined in (\ref{eq:markov_transition_rate}) can 
be used to get the probability vector \( \pi \).
The vector \( \pi \) is commonly used to study stochastic systems and it's main
purpose is to keep track of the probability of being at any given state of 
the system. 
\(\pi_i\) is the steady state probability of being in state \((u_i, v_i) \in 
\tilde S\) which is the \(i^{\text{th}}\) state of \(\tilde S\) for some 
ordering of \(\tilde S\).
The term \textit{steady state} refers to the instance of the vector \( \pi \) 
where the probabilities of being at any state become stable over time. 
Thus, by considering the steady state vector \( \pi \) the relationship between 
it and \( Q \) is given by:

\[
    \frac{d\pi}{dt} = \pi Q = 0
\]

Using vector \(\pi\) there are numerous performance measures of the model that 
can be calculated. 
The following equations utilise \(\pi\) to get performance measures for the 
average number of patients at the different nodes of the queueing model:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Average number of patients in the entire system: 
        \[L = \sum_{i=1}^{|\pi|} \pi_i (u_i + v_i)\]
    \item Average number of patients in the hospital: 
        \[L_H = \sum_{i=1}^{|\pi|} \pi_i v_i\]
    \item Average number of patients/ambulances in the parking space:
        \[L_A = \sum_{i=1}^{|\pi|} \pi_i u_i\] 
\end{itemize}

Consequently, there are some additional performance measures of interest that
are not as straightforward to calculate.
Such performance measures are the mean waiting time in the system (for both 
type 1 and type 2 individuals), the mean time blocked in the parking space (only
valid for type 2 individuals) and the proportion of individuals in the hospital
whose waiting time falls within a predefined time target (for both types).
