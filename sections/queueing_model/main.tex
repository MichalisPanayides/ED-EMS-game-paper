\section{A queueing model with 2 consecutive buffer centres}\label{sec:queueing_model}
% TODO: If this is to be one paper maybe the first two paragraphs do not need to
% include so much details or even better omit some of the details in the game
% overview section.
In this section, a more in-depth explanation of the queueing model shown in 
figure \ref{fig:diagram_of_queueing_system} will be given.
This is a queuing model that consists of two waiting spaces, one for each type
of individual.

The model consists of two types of individuals; type 1 and type 2.
Type 1 individuals arrive instantly at waiting zone 1 and wait to receive their 
service. 
Type 2 individuals arrive at waiting zone 2 and wait there until they are 
allowed to move to waiting zone 1. 
They are allowed to proceed only when the number of 
individuals in waiting zone 1 \textbf{and} in service is less than a 
pre-determined threshold \(T\).
When the number of individuals is equal to or exceeds this threshold, all 
second type individuals that arrive will stay 
\textit{``blocked''} in waiting zone 2 until the number of people in 
the next queue and in service falls below \(T\). 
This is shown diagrammatically in figure \ref{fig:diagram_of_queueing_system}.
The parameters of the described queueing model are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\lambda_i\): The arrival rate of individuals of type 
    \(i\in\{1, 2\}\)
    \item \(\mu\): The service rate for individuals receiving service
    \item \(C\): The number of servers
    \item \(T\): The threshold at which individuals of the second type are 
    blocked
\end{itemize}

Under the assumption that all rates (arrival and service) are Markovian the
queuing system corresponds to a Markov chain~\cite{kemeny1976markov}.
The states of the Markov chain are denoted by \((u,v)\) where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(u\) is the number of individuals blocked
    \item \(v\) is the number of individuals either in waiting zone 1 or in the
    service centre
\end{itemize}

We denote the state space of the Markov chain as  \(S=S(T)\) which can be 
written as the disjoint union (\ref{eq:definition_of_S_as_disjoint_union}).

\begin{align}
    S(T) =& S_1(T) \cup S_2(T) \text{ where:} \nonumber \\
    S_1(T) =& \left\{(0, v)\in\mathbb{N}_0^2 \; | \; v < T \right\} 
    \label{eq:definition_of_S_as_disjoint_union} \\
    S_2(T) =& \{(u, v)\in\mathbb{N}_0^2 \; | \; v \geq T \} \nonumber
\end{align}

The generator matrix \(Q\) of the Markov chain consists of the 
rates between the numerous states of the model. 
Every entry \( Q_{ij} = Q_{(u_i, v_i),(u_j, v_j)} \) represents the rate from 
state \( i = (u_i, v_i) \) to state \( j = (u_j , v_j) \) for all 
\( (u_i, v_i), (u_j, v_j) \in S \).
The entries of \(Q\) can be calculated using the state-mapping function 
described in (\ref{eq:markov_transition_rate}): 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:markov_transition_rate}
    Q_{ij} = 
    \begin{cases}
        \Lambda, & \textbf{if } (u_i, v_i) - (u_j, v_j) = (0,-1) \textbf{ and } 
        v_i < \text{t} \\
        \lambda_1, & \textbf{if } (u_i, v_i) - (u_j, v_j) = (0,-1) 
        \textbf{ and } v_i \geq \text{t} \\
        \lambda_2, & \textbf{if } (u_i, v_i) - (u_j, v_j) = (-1,0) \\
        v_i \mu, & \textbf{if } (u_i, v_i) - (u_j, v_j) = (0,1) \textbf{ and } 
        v_i \leq C \textbf{ or} \\ & \hspace{0.37cm}(u_i, v_i) - (u_j, v_j) = 
        (1,0) \textbf{ and } v_i = T \leq C \\
        C \mu, & \textbf{if } (u_i, v_i) - (u_j, v_j) = (0,1) \textbf{ and } 
        v_i > C 
        \textbf{ or} \\ & \hspace{0.37cm}(u_i, v_i) - (u_j, v_j) = (1,0) 
        \textbf{ and } v_i = T > C\\
        -\sum_{j=1}^{|Q|}{Q_{ij}} & \textbf{if } i = j \\
        0, & \textbf{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Note that \(\Lambda\) here denotes the overall arrival rate in the model by both 
types of individuals (i.e. \(\Lambda = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2\)). 
A visualisation of how the transition rates relate to the states of the model 
can be seen in the general Markov chain model shown in figure 
\ref{fig:general_markov_model}.

In order to consider this model numerically an adjustment needs to be made. 
The problem defined above assumes no upper boundary to the number of individuals 
that can wait for service or for the ones that are blocked in the buffer centre. 
Therefore, a different state space \( \tilde S \) is constructed where 
\( \tilde S \subseteq S \) and there is a maximum allowed number of individuals 
\(N\) that can be in the system and a maximum allowed number of individuals 
\(M\) that can be blocked in the buffer centre:

\begin{equation}
    \tilde S = \left\{ (u, v) \in S\;| u \leq M, v\leq N \right\}
\end{equation}


The generator matrix \( Q \) defined in (\ref{eq:markov_transition_rate}) can 
be used to get the probability vector \( \pi \).
The vector \( \pi \) is commonly used to study stochastic systems and it's main
purpose is to keep track of the probability of being at any given state of 
the system. 
\(\pi_i\) is the steady state probability of being in state \((u_i, v_i) \in 
\tilde S\) which is the \(i^{\text{th}}\) state of \(\tilde S\) for some ordering of 
\(\tilde S\).
The term \textit{steady state} refers to the instance of the vector \( \pi \) 
where the probabilities of being at any state become stable over time. 
Thus, by considering the steady state vector \( \pi \) the relationship between 
it and \( Q \) is given by:

\[
    \frac{d\pi}{dt} = \pi Q = 0
\]

Using vector \(\pi\) there are numerous performance measures of the model that 
can be calculated. 
The following equations utilise \(\pi\) to get performance measures on the 
average number of people at certain sets of state.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Average number of people in the system: 
        \[L = \sum_{i=1}^{|\pi|} \pi_i (u_i + v_i)\]
    \item Average number of people in the service centre: 
        \[L_H = \sum_{i=1}^{|\pi|} \pi_i v_i\]
    \item Average number of people in waiting zone 2:
        \[L_A = \sum_{i=1}^{|\pi|} \pi_i u_i\] 
\end{itemize}

Consequently, there are some additional performance measures of interest that
are not as straightforward to calculate.
Such performance measures are the mean waiting time in the system (for both 
type 1 and type 2 individuals), the mean time blocked in waiting zone 2 (only 
valid for type 2 individuals) and the proportion of individuals that wait in 
waiting zone 1 within a predefined time target (for both types).
