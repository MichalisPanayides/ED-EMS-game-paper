\section{Strategic manipulation of the ED-EMS interface} \label{sec:model_overview}

The problem studied is a 3-player normal form game. The players are:
  
\begin{itemize}
    \item the decision makers of two Emergency Departments (EDs)
    \item the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) that distribute individuals in 
    ambulances to the EDs
\end{itemize}

This is a standard normal form game~\cite{Maschler2013},  
in that each player in this game has their own objectives which they aim to 
optimise.
More specifically, the EDs' objective is captured by an upper bound
of the time that a fixed proportion of individuals spend in the system, 
while the EMS aims to minimise the time that its ambulances 
are blocked.
This can be generalised for any such system where instead of EDs there are some
queueing systems and instead of the EMS there is some distributor that allocates
individuals to the queueing systems.

The parameters of the model correspond to the following parameters of the ED 
and the EMS:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \lambda_2 \): The rate of patients (who can be blocked) that the 
    EMS receives and distributes to EDs
    \item \( \lambda_{1_i} \): The arrival rate of other patients to ED 
    \(i\in\{A, B\}\)
    \item \( \mu_i \): The service rate of patients at ED \(i\in\{A, B\}\)
    \item \( C_i \): The number of available resources (healthcare 
    professionals) in the ED \(i\in\{A, B\}\)
    \item \( T_i \): The action that ED \(i\in\{A, B\} \) chooses to play which 
    corresponds to the threshold at which they do not accept EMS patients.
    \item \( N_i \): The total patient capacity of the ED \(i\in\{A, B\} \)
    \item \( M_i \): The total parking capacity of the ED \(i\in\{A, B\} \)
    \item \( t \): The time target for both EDs
    \item \( \alpha \in [0, 1] \) : Weighted average of blocking time and 
    lost individuals (equation \ref{eq:obj_distributor})
\end{itemize}

The strategies of the two EDs are the range of thresholds that they can choose
from and their utilities is the proportion of individuals whose time in the 
system is within a predetermined target time.
The EMS has to decide how to distribute its patients among the two EDs so that 
the weighted combination of the ambulance blocking time and the percentage of 
lost ambulances is minimised. 
This can be illustrated by figure \ref{fig:diagram_of_game_theoretic_model}.
The interaction between the two
EDs is a normal form game that is then used to inform the decision of the EMS.
Note that the formulated game here assumes that prior to making a choice the 
EMS knows the strategies that each ED is playing (figure 
\ref{fig:imperfect_info_game}). 
This corresponds to reacting to experienced delays.

The queueing systems of the hospitals are designed in such a way where they can
accept two types of individuals (section \ref{sec:queueing_model}). 
Each hospital may then choose to block type 2 individuals 
when the hospital reaches a certain capacity. 
The strategy sets for each hospital is the set 
\( \{T \in \mathbb{N} \;|\; 1 \leq T \leq N\} \) where \(N \in\{N_A, N_B\}\) are 
the total capacities of hospitals \(A\) and \(B\). We denote the chosen actions 
from the strategy set as \(T_A, T_B\) and call these \textit{threshold}s.

Both hospitals follow a queueing model with two waiting spaces for 
individuals. 
The first waiting space (i.e. the waiting space of the hospital) is where the 
patients queue right before receiving 
their service and has a queue capacity of \( N - C \), where \(N\) is the total 
capacity of the hospital and \(C\) is the number of healthcare 
professionals able to see them.
The second waiting space (i.e. the parking space for ambulances) is where 
ambulances, that are sent from the
ambulance service, stay until their patients are allowed to enter the hospital.
The parking space has a capacity of \(M\) and no servers.
This is shown diagrammatically in Figure~\ref{fig:diagram_of_queueing_system}.

Note here that both types of individuals can become lost to the system. 
An individual allocated from the ambulance service becomes lost to the system 
whenever 
an arrival occurs and the parking space is at full capacity (\(M\) 
ambulances already parked).
Similarly, type 1 individuals get lost whenever they arrive at the waiting 
space of the hospital and it is at full capacity (\(N - C\) individuals already
waiting).

Following this queueing model, the two queueing systems' choice of strategy will 
then rely solely on satisfying their own objective.
The objective function is defined as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:obj_queueing_systems}
    \arg \max_{T_i} \quad -\left( \hat{P} - P(W_i < t) \right)^2 \qquad 
    i \in {A, B}
\end{equation}

where \(W\) is the waiting time of a potential individual, \(t\) is the time 
target and \(\hat{P}\) is the percentage of individuals need to be within that 
target. 
In other words, their aim is to find the threshold that minimises the 
difference between the probability \(P(W_i < t)\) and the percentage goal 
(or maximise its negation).

The third player, the ambulance service, has their own choices to make and 
their own 
goals to satisfy.
The strategy set of the third player is the proportion \(0 \leq p_A \leq 1\) of 
individuals to send to hospital A.
Similarly the proportion of individuals to send to hospital B is given by
\(p_B = 1 - p_A\).
In addition, the ambulance service aims to minimise any potential blockages
that may occur, given the pair of thresholds chosen by the two hospitals.
Thus, its objective is to minimise the blocked time of the individuals 
(\(B_A\) and \(B_B\))
that they send to hospitals \(A\) and \(B\).
Apart from the time being blocked, an additional aspect that may affect the 
decision of the distributor is the proportion of lost individuals 
\(L_A\) and \(L_B\).
Equation \ref{eq:obj_distributor} can be used to capture a mixture 
between the two objectives \(L_i\) and \(B_i\) where \(i \in \{A, B\}\):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:obj_distributor}
    (p_A, p_B) \quad s.t. \quad 
    \alpha L_A(p_A) + (1 - \alpha) B_A(p_A) = 
    \alpha L_B(p_B) + (1 - \alpha) B_B(p_B)
\end{equation}

Here, \(\alpha\) represents the ``importance'' of each objective,
where high \(\alpha\) indicates a higher weight on the proportion of lost 
individuals and smaller \(\alpha\) a higher weight on the time blocked. 
Note here that the choice of \(p_A\) and \(p_B\) rely solely on equation
\ref{eq:obj_distributor}.
An extension that can be applied here is the use of unobservable queues.
The ambulance service does not necessarily know at which state hospitals A and
B are at, and thus may need to make decisions based on other
information~\cite{unobservablequeue}.
While this is not an unrealistic scenario it is outside of the scope of this
paper.
There are several other factors that can affect the routing of the patients 
that are also outside the scope, for example the distance of each hospital or
even the priority level of each patient.

Using either equation (\ref{eq:obj_distributor}) or 
(\ref{eq:obj_queueing_systems}) gives an imperfect information extensive form 
game. 
An imperfect information game is defined as an extensive form game where some 
of the information about the game state is hidden for at least one of the 
players~\cite{Berwanger2008}. In this study the state of the problem that is
hidden is the threshold that each of the hospitals chooses to play.
In other words, each hospital chooses to play a strategy without 
knowing the other hospital's strategy.
The ambulance service then, fully aware of the chosen threshold strategies, 
distributes individuals among the two systems in order to minimise the time 
that its ambulances will be blocked. 
Figure \ref{fig:imperfect_info_game} illustrates this.

\end{figure}

Hospital \(H_A\) decides on a threshold, then the hospital \(H_B\)
chooses its own threshold, without knowing the strategy of \(H_A\), and finally
the ambulance service makes its choice. 
Note here that the dotted line represents the
fact that \(H_B\) is unaware of the state of the game when making its own 
decisions. 

From equation \ref{eq:obj_queueing_systems} the utilities of the
hospitals can be formulated.
The 2-player normal form game between the two hospitals is defined by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Players}: Hospitals \(H_A\) and \(H_B\)
    \item \textbf{Strategy spaces}: \(T_A = \{1, 2, \dots, N_A\}, 
    T_B = \{1, 2, \dots, N_B\}\)
    \item \textbf{Utilities}:    
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:payoff_entry}
        U_{T_A, T_B}^i = 1 - \left( \hat{P} - P(W_i < t) \right)^2 \quad
        \textbf{where } i \in \{A, B\}
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

Consequently, the payoff matrices of the game can be populated by these 
utilities:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:payoff_matrices}
    A = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        U_{1,1}^A & U_{1,2}^A & \dots & U_{1,N_B}^A \\
        U_{2,1}^A & U_{2,2}^A & \dots & U_{2,N_B}^A \\
        \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
        U_{N_A,1}^A & U_{N_A,2}^A & \dots & U_{N_A,N_B}^A \\
    \end{pmatrix}, \,
    B = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        U_{1,1}^B & U_{1,2}^B & \dots & U_{1,N_B}^B \\
        U_{2,1}^B & U_{2,2}^B & \dots & U_{2,N_B}^B \\
        \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
        U_{N_A,1}^B & U_{N_A,2}^B & \dots & U_{N_A,N_B}^B \\
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

Based on the choice of strategy of these two hospitals, the ambulance service 
will then make their own choice of the proportion of individuals to send to
each system.
