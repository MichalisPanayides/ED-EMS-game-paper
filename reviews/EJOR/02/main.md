# Reviewer 1
The manuscript is well-revised and the results sound good. I understand that their results are interesting, and the paper is suitable for publication after a minor revision.

Comment: The following two papers are related to the current work and I suggest the authors add them in the references with citations in the literature review:

1. Chen, W., Z. G. Zhang, and X. Chen. 2020. "On Two-tier Healthcare System Under Capacity Constraint." International Journal of Production Research 58 (12): 3744-3764.
2. Wang, J., Z. Wang, Z. G. Zhang and F. Wang. 2021. "Efficiency-quality trade-off in allocating resource to public healthcare systems." International Journal of Production Research, DOI: 10.1080/00207543.2021.1992529


# Reviewer 2
I gave a look into the new version and the comments made by the authors following the reviews they received.
My criticism towards the paper as stated in the first round stays. It is basically the question of what are the standards of EJOR. If a paper which states a interesting model and gives details on numerical procedures for solving it but without any theorems and insights is good enough, then it should be accepted as the paper is doing a good job of what it promises.
Otherwise, they should look for a more applied journal where what they do is sufficient.


# Reviewer 3
The authors handled my remarks well.
