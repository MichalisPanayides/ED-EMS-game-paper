# Reviewer 1
1. Rewrite the Highlights (for review) of the paper, and really capture the sense of work.
2. Combine Sections 2 and 5 together to demonstrate the underlying queueing models and the EMS - ED interface counterpart. The current arrangement is not easy to follow for finding the right explanations for each part of the assumptions adopted in the article.
3. In the game-theoretic formulation and analysis part, it is better to present the essential components of a normal-form representation, including the players in the game, the strategies available to each player and the payoff received by each player for each combination of strategies that could be chosen by the players, etc.
4. To highlight the contributions of this work, it is necessary to compare the novelty of this work with previous results in the literature.
5. There are some mistakes/typos with English grammar and writing in the article.
Although there are some merits in the modelling perspective and derivations of the results, I am afraid that this paper has not enough novelty from perspectives of theoretic studies and methodologic exploration, and thus have the following recommendation.

Recommendation: Considering the above reasons, I recommend Major Revise – requires re-writing and re-evaluation.


# Reviewer 2
The model suggested might have an interest of its own right but the paper comes only with numerical results based on simulations or  on solving for resulting Markov chains. There is no further theory or enough insight stated. In particular, no theorem is postulated in the paper. This is below the standards of a leading journal such as EJOR and thus I recommend rejection.

I would recommend the authors that in case that they decide to submit the paper to a more oriented healthcare management journal that they will put a dedicated section which deals with the model. As it is now, its informal and its formal descriptions are put together, making it hard on the reader to see what is the exact analysed model.


# Reviewer 3

The paper treats an interesting problem, but has some shortcomings:
1. Sections 1 and 2 are difficult to read. It would be better to focus on the main contribution and its motivation in Section 1, and to put the literature review in a separate Section.
2. Also: since the application in mind is the EMS-ED interface, it would be better to write the paper immediately from this perspective, instead of first abstracting it and then applying it to that problem.
3. In section 2, a diagram of the full system (including the two queues and the EMS) would increase readability.
4. The authors claim their model has applications in a range of sectors and settings, but have given no examples.
5. A key modelling assumption is that a fraction p_A of patients is distributed to hospital A. Some comments on how realistic this is should be added. Do distributers have a choice? Don't they just have to choose the nearest hospital? Do they really do it randomly, don' t they take into account queues at the hospitals (e.g. join the shortest ambulance queue)? what about urgency of patients? I would expect patients that come in are prioritized since they are probably more urgent.
6. Figure 3: about solving the Markov chain: the Markov chain is truncated to solve it. Therefore, probably N and M are not too small. What about the numerical complexity? Because if you just solve it, you have to invert the matrix? Is there some structure in the Markov chain that can be exploited if N and M would be large?
1. Figures 4-6: why do you compare your calculated values with simulation? Is it to evaluate the truncations? Or are you not sure about the formulas?
1. Figs 7-11: Row player and Column Player are unclear: hospital 1 and hospital 2 would be a better choice I presume.
1. Page 22 scenario at bottom of the page: this scenario does not seem like a realistic scenario: the mean number of patients offered per time unit is larger than that can be treated, meaning that many patients would be rejected by the hospital. Please comment on the reality of the selected scenarios.

# Editor
As you can see from the reports below, the referees are very critical with respect to your paper. In these circumstances, it has been decided that your paper should be reconsidered for publication in the EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH if you can revise it to meet the enclosed referees' comments. (You may wish to argue that some comments are invalid). Please also ensure that you have cited recent and relevant publications in EJOR and other OR journals.

I would like to emphasise that the reviewers are rather critical about some parts of your paper and I have considered rejecting the paper immediately. Therefore, I expect that you take into serious consideration all criticisms made. In particular, I fully agree with the reviewers that a closer connection with the real-world setting is necessary. Please, don´t take this "Major Revision" decision as a granted publication. My final decision will heavily depend on the revised version of the paper and the following comments from the reviewers.

When resubmitting the revised paper, please upload a separate list of your answers to the referees, separately for each referee. NOTE: Upon submitting your revised manuscript, please upload the source files for your article.

When submitting your revised paper, we ask that you include the following items:
- Response to Reviewers (mandatory)
    This should be a separate file labelled "Response to Reviewers" that carefully addresses, point-by-point, the issues raised in the comments appended below. You should also include a suitable rebuttal to any specific request for change that you have not made. Mention the page, paragraph, and line number of any revisions that are made, and highlight these parts of the text in the revised manuscript.
- Manuscript and Figure Source Files (mandatory)
    We cannot accommodate PDF manuscript files for production purposes. We also ask that when submitting your revision you follow the journal formatting guidelines. Figures and tables may be embedded within the source file for the submission as long as they are of sufficient visual quality. For any figure that cannot be embedded within the source file (such as *.PSD Photoshop files), the original figure needs to be uploaded separately. Refer to the Guide for Authors for additional information.
- Highlights (mandatory)
    Highlights consist of a short collection of bullet points that convey the core findings of the article and should be submitted in a separate file in the online submission system. Please use 'Highlights' in the file name and include 3 to 5 bullet points (maximum 85 characters, including spaces, per bullet point). See the following website for more information
